The project is to design a website for Archiverse an incubation project I am working on for VR development.
The idea is to use React concepts like Components, JSX, States and Props to further cement my knowledge and skills

The project below utlizes react concepts starting with use of components to render the header, footer and main body
Concepts like use of React-DOM to make use of the html Dom along with react libraries are used
Babel is used to translate JSX back to html and regular JS is used in order to get more applications like conditions
The card components are not hard-coded as before by use of props, which means we are able to get data from objects and arrays
In this case I used the map() function to map the data from the data array to a new one, while selecting every index and implementing codes
There is a bit of conditional rendering where prices lower that 29000 have a discount mini card shown
